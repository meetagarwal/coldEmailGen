## **How It Works**  

1. **User Inputs a Job Posting URL**  
   - The user provides a link to a job listing (e.g., Flipkart Careers page).  
   - The application fetches the webpage content.  

2. **Web Scraping & Text Cleaning**  
   - The system extracts raw text from the provided webpage.  
   - HTML tags, unwanted characters, and unnecessary whitespace are removed.  
   - The cleaned job description is prepared for analysis.  

3. **AI-Based Job Information Extraction**  
   - A Large Language Model (LLM) analyzes the job description.  
   - It identifies key details, such as:  
     - **Role** (e.g., Data Scientist, Software Engineer)  
     - **Experience Level** (e.g., Entry-Level, 3+ Years)  
     - **Required Skills** (e.g., Python, Machine Learning)  
     - **Job Description** (Summarized from the listing)  
   - The extracted job data is formatted into structured JSON.  

4. **Portfolio Matching with Relevant Projects**  
   - The system maintains a portfolio database containing past projects and skills.  
   - AI matches the jobâ€™s required skills with relevant past projects.  
   - The most relevant portfolio links are selected to showcase expertise.  

5. **Cold Email Generation**  
   - AI generates a personalized cold email using the extracted job details.  
   - The email highlights relevant experience and how the business can meet the jobâ€™s needs.  
   - Selected portfolio links are embedded in the email for credibility.  

6. **Email Output & User Interaction**  
   - The generated email is displayed in the **Streamlit UI**.  
   - The user can copy, modify, and send the email directly.
